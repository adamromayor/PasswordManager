# PasswordManager

This is a password manager.

This program stores a users' passwords and username/email on a local database.
The passwords are encrypted and stored. A user can add a website and username/password
combination.

The user has the option to generate a random 16 character password that includes 
letters, numbers, and special characters.

Multiple users can use this program, and their password info will be kept separate from
other users. Database setup is required, but the code in pm.py shows the structure.

This is a command line program.
